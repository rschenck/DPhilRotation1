3	GM08714	lymphoblastoid cell line, Instability of heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16 with variable combined immunodeficiency; dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, malabsorption, and recurrent infections; see GM08747 Fibroblast; donor subject is a compound heterozygote: one allele has a G>A transition at nucleotide 1807 (1807G>A) of the DNMT3B gene resulting in an Ala to Thr substitution at codon 603 [Ala603Thr (A603T)], the mutation occurring in a region between motifs I and IV within the catalytic domain of DNMT3B; the second allele has a G>A transition within intron 22 located 11 nucleotides 5-prime of the normal splice acceptor site [IVS22AS,G>A,-11] resulting in the generation of a novel splice acceptor site and a 9-bp insertion in the processed RNA. This results in the insertion of 3 amino acids (serine, threonine, and proline) at codon 744 (744ins3). The insertion was within the conserved region of the catalytic domain, which is likely to be disrupted by the insertion of a proline residue. This mutation was de novo.	mesoderm	blood	F
